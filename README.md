# Summoners-War-Script

About

This script will use your arena wings in the mobile app game called Summoners War. I used Blue Stacks to play Summoners War on my computer.
The script will guide you to the arena, prompt how many wings you'd like to use and cycle through arena battles. There is a feature to only
auto each arena battle, or what this script focuses on, using an arena offense called Double Lushen. It will pcik each skill in order and 
then auto the rest of the battle if any monsters remain. It will loop through this process until all wings that were specified are used.

Future improvments:
Allow the player to skip certain battles when the enemy team consists of specific monsters.
Refresh the list of players to battle. 


What did I learn from my first project:

-How to use pip to install packages.
-How to read documentation.
-Ability to research and solve specific problems.
-How to create classes and inherit from other classes.
-How to access data from dictionaries and lists.
-Using OpenCV, PYautoGUI, and numpy arraays to locate target pixels on screen.
