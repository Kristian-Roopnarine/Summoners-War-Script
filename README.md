# Summoners-War-Script

About

This script will use your arena wings in the mobile app game called Summoners War. I used Blue Stacks to play Summoners War on my computer.
The script will guide you to the arena, prompt how many wings you'd like to use and cycle through arena battles. There is a feature to only
auto each arena battle, or what this script focuses on, using an arena offense called Double Lushen. It will pcik each skill in order and 
then auto the rest of the battle if any monsters remain. It will loop through this process until all wings that were specified are used.
